# Project Overview

## Project Name: **FNova Publishing Website Redesign**

### Tagline/Summary  
*Empowering authors to share meaningful stories that uplift and inspire, making the world better one book at a time.*

---

## 1. Key Features
- Dynamic display of book catalog with detailed book pages.
- "About Us" section with mission and vision.
- Contact section with address and form.
- Author submission portal (future enhancement).
- Integration with external book purchase platforms (Amazon, Goodreads).

---

## 2. Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **React** for UI development.

### Styling:
- **Tailwind CSS** (proposed) for rapid, responsive, and modern design.
  - Alternative: Styled Components (if component-scoped styling is preferred).

### Core Logic:
- Client-side routing and UI rendering.
- Simple form handling and validation (for Contact, future Author Portal).

### Backend/API Integration:
- **Headless CMS (Strapi or WordPress)** for book data and author profiles.
- External e-commerce links (Amazon, Goodreads) for book purchase.

### State Management:
- **Zustand** (lightweight state management) for UI state.
  - Redux only if complex state logic emerges (e.g., filters, favorites).

### Build Tool:
- **Vite** (proposed for faster dev/build performance) or **Next.js** (if SSR/SEO is prioritized).

### Deployment:
- **Vercel** (ideal for React/Next.js) or **Netlify** (good for SPA).

## 3. Architecture Design

### Core Components:
- **Header:** Logo, navigation.
- **Hero Section:** Tagline and impactful imagery.
- **Book Catalog/Grid:** List of all books dynamically from CMS.
- **Book Detail Pages:** Synopsis, author info, and purchase links.
- **About Us Section:** Mission and vision.
- **Contact Section:** Address, map embed, and form.
- **Footer:** Copyright, quick links.

### Additional Components (Future Enhancements):
- Author Submission Portal (form with file upload).
- Search/filter for book catalog.

---

## 4. User Interface Design

### Main Layout:
- Clean, modern, and visually engaging design.
- Clear navigation between **Books**, **About Us**, and **Contact**.

### Key UI Features:
- **Book Cards:** Cover, title, author (hover animation for details).
- **Book Detail Pages:** Extended details, related books, and purchase links.
- **Contact Form:** Simple validated form (name, email, message).
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layout with optimized scaling.

### Design Direction:
- Minimalist color palette (whitespaces, accent color for CTAs).
- Typography emphasizing readability and elegance (serif for titles, sans-serif for body).
- Subtle animations for hover and transitions (CSS/Framer Motion).

---

## 5. Data Flow Architecture

### Data Sources:
- **CMS API**: Book listings, author details.
- **Static Content**: "About Us", contact details.

### Flow:
1. **Frontend** fetches data via CMS REST/GraphQL API.
2. **UI** renders dynamic components (catalog, detail pages).
3. **Contact Form** sends submissions via API endpoint or third-party form handler (e.g., Formspree).
4. Future: **Author Portal** handles form submissions with file upload to backend.

---

## 6. Security & Performance

### Security:
- Input validation for forms.
- HTTPS/SSL enforced (platform-managed via Vercel/Netlify).
- Secure CMS API endpoints (read-only public tokens).

### Performance Optimizations:
- Image lazy loading and compression (using Next/Image or similar tools).
- Code splitting and bundling (automatic in Vite/Next.js).
- CDN-backed hosting for static assets.

### Error Handling:
- Graceful UI messages for failed data loads.
- Global fallback pages for 404 and API errors.

---

## 7. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Initialize React project.
- Implement layout components (Header, Footer, Navigation).
- Connect CMS API for book data.

### Phase 2: Book Catalog & Detail Pages
- Create catalog grid and dynamic book detail pages.
- Add external links (Amazon, Goodreads).

### Phase 3: About Us & Contact
- Build "About Us" section.
- Add Contact section:  
  *Address: 3948 Legacy Dr. Ste. 106-371 Plano, TX 75023.*

### Phase 4: Enhancements
- Filtering/sorting for book catalog.
- Author submission portal (future).

## 8. Getting Started

1. **Initialize Project:**  
   - `npm create vite@latest` (or Next.js if SSR is chosen).  

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   - React, Tailwind CSS (or preferred styling).  
   - Axios (for API calls).  

3. **Configure CMS API:**  
   - Set up API keys (if needed).  

4. **Implement Components:**  
   - Start with static mock data, then integrate API.

5. **Deploy:**  
   - Push to GitHub â†’ Deploy to Vercel/Netlify.

---

## 9. Development Workflow

- **Feature branching (Git).**
- **TypeScript:** For type safety (optional but recommended).
- **Unit testing (Jest/React Testing Library):** For UI components and API calls.
- **Responsive design checks:** Manual + automated (Lighthouse).

---

## 10. Architecture (Simplified)

### Presentation Layer:
- **React UI Components** (Header, Hero, Catalog, Detail, About, Contact).

### Business Logic:
- API fetching (CMS book data).
- Local UI state management (filters, modals).

### Data Layer:
- Headless CMS (Strapi/WordPress).
- External APIs (Amazon/Goodreads for purchase links).
