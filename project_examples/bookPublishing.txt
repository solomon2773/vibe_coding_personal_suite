Project Overview
Project Name: FNova Publishing Website Redesign

Tagline/Summary: Empowering authors to share meaningful stories that uplift and inspire, making the world better one book at a time.

Key Features:

Dynamic display of book catalog with detailed book pages.

Author submission portal (future enhancement).

"About Us" section with mission and vision.

Contact/address information.

Multi-Agent Collaboration and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for internal content management and potentially for assisting authors (future). 

2. Technology Stack

Frontend: React 

Styling: (To be determined, e.g., Tailwind CSS, Styled Components)

Core Logic:

Agentic reasoning engine for potential internal use (e.g., content analysis, author matching). 

Standard website logic for content rendering and navigation.

Backend/API Integration:

Likely a Content Management System (CMS) API (e.g., Strapi, headless WordPress) for managing book data and author information.

Potentially LangGraph, AutoGen, or OpenAI API for advanced agentic features (future). 


State Management: Redux/Zustand + MCP (for agent-driven features). 

Build Tool: (To be determined, e.g., Vite, Next.js built-in)

Deployment: (To be determined, e.g., Vercel, Netlify)

3. Architecture Design
Core Components:

Header (Logo, Navigation)

Hero Section (Tagline, imagery)

Book Catalog/Grid

Individual Book Detail Pages

About Us Section

Contact Section

Footer (Copyright, Address)


Multi-Agent & Agentic Agent Design (Primarily for internal tools initially, or future author-facing features) 

Agent Roles:

Content Agent: Assists in populating book details, potentially suggesting categorization. (Future)

Editorial Agent: Provides feedback or analysis on submitted manuscripts. (Future)

Marketing Agent: Helps with generating marketing copy or social media blurbs for books. (Future)


Model Context Protocol (MCP) for shared agent memory: Enables agents to share common data regarding books, authors, and publishing guidelines. 


Agent Orchestration Strategy: (To be determined based on specific agent use cases, e.g., sequential, parallel, or hierarchical workflows.) 

4. User Interface Design
Main Layout:

Clean, modern, and inviting design.

Prominent display of books.

Clear navigation to "Books," "About Us," and "Contact."

Key UI Features:

Book Cards: Visually appealing cards for each book with cover, title, and author.

Book Detail Pages: Dedicated pages for each book with synopsis, author info, purchase links (Amazon, Goodreads), and potentially related books.


Agent Timeline / MCP Viewer: (Internal tool for monitoring agent activities, not user-facing initially). 


Responsiveness: Fully responsive design for optimal viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 

5. Data Flow Architecture

State/Data Type Flow (User → Agents → UI): 

User Input: Browse actions, form submissions (future author portal).

Agents: Internal agents may process data (e.g., for content management).

UI: Renders fetched book data, author information, and static content.


MCP Synchronization and Agent Communication: Agents will communicate and synchronize data relevant to content management and publishing workflows via MCP. 

API/External Integration Flow:

Fetch book data from CMS API.

Link to external e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Goodreads).

Future integration with AI APIs for agentic capabilities.

6. Security & Performance
Security:

Input validation for any user-submitted forms. 

(Agent sandboxing for future agent integrations, if applicable). 

Performance Optimizations:

Lazy loading of images and off-screen components. 

Memoization for frequently accessed data or complex computations. 

Error Handling:

Graceful display of error messages for API failures.

(Agent fallback mechanisms for internal agent errors). 

7. Development Phases

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure: 

Set up React project.

Implement basic UI components (Header, Footer, Navigation).

Integrate with a CMS for initial book data display.

Phase 2: Book Catalog & Detail Pages:

Develop book listing and individual book detail pages.

Implement filtering/sorting if needed for a large catalog.

Phase 3: About Us & Contact:

Build out the "About Us" section with Mission and Vision.

Create the Contact section with address: 3948 Legacy Dr. Ste. 106-371 Plano, TX 75023.


Phase 4: Advanced Agent Capabilities (Future): 

Integrate agentic reasoning engine for internal content management or author assistance.

Implement Multi-Agent Collaboration and MCP for specific workflows.

8. Getting Started

Initialize project: Create a new React project using a chosen build tool. 


Install dependencies: Install necessary libraries for React, styling, state management, etc. 


Set up API keys/environment variables: Configure access to the CMS API and any other external services. 


Follow project structure: Adhere to a logical and scalable folder structure. 


Implement agent and MCP core: (As needed for initial internal agent features). 

9. Development Workflow

Feature branching: Utilize a feature branching strategy for development. 


Type safety: Employ TypeScript for strong typing and Zod for schema validation where applicable. 


Agent testing: Implement unit and integration tests for any agentic functionalities. 


Documentation: Document MCP schema and agent protocols as they are developed. 

10. Architecture

Architectural Pattern: Agent-Oriented + Component-Based. 


Presentation Layer: React-based UI for rendering all visual elements. 

Business Logic Layer:

Multi-Agent Orchestration (for internal processes). 

MCP for shared memory among agents and potentially for managing website content in an agent-driven way. 

Traditional business logic for data fetching and display.

Data Layer:

API calls to CMS and external services (Amazon, Goodreads). 

Shared memory (via MCP for agents). 

Local storage (for user preferences, if any). 


State Management: Redux/Zustand for global UI state and Model Context Protocol for agent-related shared state.
